This project is part of the Frontend Mentor challenge. In this mini project, I used:

- React + Vite ⚛️ + ⚡️
- TailwindCSS 🖤

I'm really proud of how this turned out, especially since I completed it using new tools I recently learned. 💪 I hope you enjoy it and welcome any feedback or suggestions to improve the code quality. 😊
